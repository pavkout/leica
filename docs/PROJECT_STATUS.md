# Rangefinder — Project Status

Last updated: 2026-09-26

## Current state

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| Phase 0 — Repository Audit & Foundation | ✅ COMPLETE |
| Phase 1 — M3 Film Companion | ✅ COMPLETE |
| Phase 2 — Tactile Learning | 🟡 IN PROGRESS |
| Phase 3 — “WTF” / 3D Layer | ⬜ NOT STARTED |
| Phase 4 — Explore / Kiosk / Museum | ⬜ NOT STARTED |

> Phase 0 and Phase 1 were verified directly against the repository (typecheck/lint/test/build all clean, 126 tests passing before this session's work) before Phase 2 began.

## Current phase

**Phase 2 — Tactile Learning**

## Current task

**Feature #11 — Push / Pull Simulation**

Status: **NOT STARTED**

Claude must read Feature #11 in `RANGEFINDER_MASTER_PLAN.md` before implementation, and must not start it until the user says to proceed (one-feature-at-a-time rule).

## Phase 2 checklist

- [x] **#3 — Physical Aperture / Iris Visualization** — COMPLETE
- [x] **#16 — Interactive Focusing Ring / DOF Scale Trainer** — COMPLETE
- [ ] **#11 — Push / Pull Simulation** — NOT STARTED
- [ ] **#27 — Portrait Distance Trainer** — NOT STARTED
- [ ] **#31 — Learn From Negatives / Scan Feedback Loop** — NOT STARTED
- [ ] **#18 — Cross-body Leica Viewfinder Comparison** — NOT STARTED
- [ ] **#32 — Mechanical Audio + Haptics** — NOT STARTED
- [ ] **#9 — Phone Gyroscope Hand-Stability Trainer** — NOT STARTED
- [ ] **#22 — Film Loading Trainer** — NOT STARTED

## Recommended Phase 2 order (resequenced — see reasoning below)

1. #3 — Physical Aperture / Iris Visualization
2. #16 — Interactive Focusing Ring / DOF Scale Trainer
3. #11 — Push / Pull Simulation
4. #27 — Portrait Distance Trainer
5. #31 — Learn From Negatives / Scan Feedback Loop
6. #18 — Cross-body Leica Viewfinder Comparison
7. #32 — Mechanical Audio + Haptics
8. #9 — Phone Gyroscope Hand-Stability Trainer
9. #22 — Film Loading Trainer

**Why reordered from the original list** (original had #9 third): #9 needs `DeviceMotionEvent`, and this development environment has no accelerometer/gyroscope exposed to the browser at all — unlike Live View's camera (which streamed real video once permission was granted), there is no path to observing real motion data here, only the "unsupported" fallback. Verifying it meaningfully needs a real phone. Moved it — and #22 (Film Loading Trainer, which needs verified manufacturer-manual sourcing for real mechanical accuracy before writing instructions for someone's real camera) — toward the end, and promoted #11/#27/#31 (all fully implementable and verifiable with existing tooling and existing Phase 1 infrastructure) ahead of them. #18 sits in the middle: achievable, but a real design decision (either multiple simultaneous WebGL viewfinder instances or a new lighter comparison renderer), not a mechanical extension — give it a focused pass on its own. This order may change again if a later feature turns out to have its own dependency issue; Claude must explain and update this file if so.

## Last completed

**Feature #3 — Physical Aperture / Iris Visualization** (Phase 2)

Implemented:
- `preview/aperture.ts`: new pure `irisOutline(shape, samples)` function, reusing the exact same `apertureRadius` edge function the WebGL bokeh kernel already uses — the iris diagram and the bokeh highlight are provably the same shape, not two independent approximations. 5 new unit tests (closed-loop geometry, perfect circle at roundness 1, per-point match against `apertureRadius`, determinism, custom sample count).
- `components/Iris.tsx`: new "Aperture · iris" panel with a Front/Side (through-lens) toggle. Front view: barrel + iris opening polygon, sized by `lens.maxAperture / fNumber` (opening diameter scales as 1/f-number). Side view: a generic schematic (tube, two element ellipses, two diaphragm blades closing toward centre) — explicitly labeled "not this lens's real optical prescription," since no per-lens optical-group data exists or was fabricated. A small out-of-focus-highlight preview sits beside both, using the same `irisOutline` geometry with a radial-gradient glow fill.
- Blade-count labeling reuses the existing convention: published count when `lens.apertureBlades` is set, otherwise "Generic 9-blade… approximation" — same wording pattern already used in the main simulated-photo panel.
- Wired into `App.tsx` right after the Focus & Aperture Rings panel (new `.stage-iris` CSS order slot, forced full-width at the tablet breakpoint alongside the lens barrel).

Manually verified in Chrome (desktop): opens correctly, front view shows a round opening at max aperture and a correct 9-gon at a stopped-down aperture with the diaphragm/bokeh preview shrinking together and staying in sync, Side view's diaphragm blades close symmetrically toward centre, generic-vs-published blade labeling reads correctly, no console errors. **Caught and fixed a real bug during this check**: the Front/Side toggle's default labels ("Front view" / "Through-lens") overflowed the shared `Segmented` component at this panel's width — the component assumes short labels (used elsewhere for "m"/"ft", "Auto"/"Manual") and doesn't wrap. Fixed by shortening the labels to "Front"/"Side" rather than modifying the shared component (lower blast radius; `Segmented` is used throughout the app).

Deliberately scoped down from the full spec: **no "through-lens" optical realism** (internal glass groups, ray tracing) — that's Feature #5 (Lens X-Ray), explicitly Phase 3 territory per `CLAUDE.md`'s phase-boundary rule, so the side view is a generic, always-the-same-shape schematic, not lens-specific data.

Validation: typecheck clean, lint 0 errors (5 pre-existing warnings, untouched files), 131/131 tests passing (was 126), clean production build.

Known limitation: not confirmed at a real narrow/mobile viewport — `resize_window` isn't taking effect in this browser-automation session (a recurring tooling issue, not specific to this feature). Static CSS review (fixed 168px/96px diagrams, `flex-wrap`, short toggle labels) suggests low risk at 390px width, but this is reasoning, not a live-confirmed check.

---

**Feature #16 — Interactive Focusing Ring / DOF Scale Trainer** (Phase 2)

Implemented:
- `utils/format.ts`: new pure `parseDistanceInput(text, units)` — the inverse of the existing `scaleLabel`, parsing a typed metres/feet value to mm, `null` for anything not a positive number. 6 new unit tests, including a round-trip check against `scaleLabel` and an explicit table of rejected inputs (empty, whitespace, non-numeric, zero, negative, `"Infinity"`).
- `components/DistanceInput.tsx`: a new labeled text input, bidirectionally synced with focus distance — types live-commit through `onFocusChange` on every valid keystroke (matching the ring's live-drag feel), local text state while focused so reformatting never fights the user's typing, re-syncs from the external `focusMm` once blurred or when it changes from elsewhere (ring drag, Zone Focus presets, Live View). Shows `∞` as a placeholder when focus is at infinity rather than the literal string "Infinity".
- Expanded the existing Zone Focus hint in `App.tsx` into a full "copy to a real lens" card: names the exact distance-scale and aperture-ring settings and the resulting near/far sharp range, reacting live to whichever aperture stop is currently selected — this single card satisfies both the "tap an aperture marking to explain covered distances" and "copy to real lens" UX requirements at once, without inventing a second interaction mode alongside the ring's existing tap-to-select.
- Did **not** modify `LensBarrel.tsx` itself — the new input is a sibling control in `App.tsx` that shares the same `setFocusMm` callback, so "bidirectional" sync falls out of the existing shared-state architecture rather than needing new wiring inside the ring component. Lower risk to a working, previously-verified component.
- "Unknown lens scale artwork falls back to generic semantic scale" was already true by construction (there's no lens-specific skin system at all — every lens already renders the same generic engraved scale) — no work needed for that acceptance criterion.

Manually verified in Chrome (desktop): typed "3" into the field — the ring's index, the DOF band, the "copy to real lens" card, the Readouts panel, and even the rangefinder viewfinder above all updated live and in sync; tapped the ring at a new position — the input field updated to match (confirmed the reverse direction, not just forward); set focus to infinity via the existing ∞ button — the input correctly showed the `∞` placeholder and the hint card read "set the distance scale to ∞" rather than anything broken. No console errors throughout.

Validation: typecheck clean, lint 0 errors (5 pre-existing warnings, untouched files), 137/137 tests passing (was 131), clean production build.

Known limitation: same as Feature #3 — not confirmed at a real narrow/mobile viewport this session. The new input uses the existing `.field`/`input[type="text"]` pattern already used (and already mobile-verified) elsewhere in the app (ISO dial, Aperture B selector in Phase 1's compare mode), so risk is judged lower than for Feature #3's custom SVG diagrams, but still not a live-confirmed check.

## Next

Start **Feature #11 — Push / Pull Simulation**.

Do not begin it automatically — wait for the user to say proceed.

Note for whoever picks up #11: `preview/film.ts`'s `FilmLook` already has `iso`/`latitude`/`softness`/`bias`/`grain` per stock, and the exposure engine already treats ISO as a free parameter (`exposureError`, `correctShutter` take `iso` directly) — film ISO is only *fixed* in the current UI because nothing lets you pick an EI separate from box speed, not because of a physics limitation. #11 likely needs: (a) an EI selector for film bodies, parallel to the existing digital ISO dial in `ExposurePanel.tsx`, feeding the *exposure* calculation; and (b) a separate "development intent" control (normal/push/pull) that adjusts the *film-response* curve (steepen/flatten `softness`, nudge `grain`) — keep these two effects visibly distinct in the UI (spec: "explain the distinction between exposure and development"). Per the spec's own allowance ("unsupported film/developer combinations fall back to generic educational mode"), a single generic push/pull curve applied uniformly across all stocks — tagged `illustrative` in `Provenance` — is honest and defensible; there's no verified per-stock push/pull data to model instead.

## Blockers

None currently recorded.

## Known limitations / verification required

- Live Leica View may currently be an alpha/v1 implementation rather than the final complete Feature #1 specification (unchanged from Phase 1).
- Mobile Safari / narrow-viewport verification remains outstanding across the whole app, not just Feature #3 — this environment cannot currently force a narrow browser viewport (`resize_window` no-ops; a CSS-zoom workaround was tried previously and doesn't affect `@media` breakpoints either). Needs a real device or a working device-emulation tool.
- Phase 3 / Virtual Leica Full 3D has not started and must not be pulled into Phase 2 accidentally.

## Phase 3 — explicitly not started

Phase 3 contains the high-impact 3D / “WTF” work, including items such as:

- Virtual Leica full 3D body/lens
- cinematic lens swap
- Lens X-Ray / optical path
- Lens DNA
- Flare Lab
- 60-second WOW demo orchestration

Do not start these while Phase 2 is active unless explicitly requested by the user.
